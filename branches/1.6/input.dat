$use_Wang_Landau$
1
indicates how to deal with quantum Wang Landau reweighting
A-priory guerss for WL weights can be read from the file "WL.dat" and then modified by the standard WL procedure
The modified weights are stored in file "WL1.dat".
Normally, use "WL1.dat" as an a-priory guess for the futher runs. 
Possible values
   0: do not use WL reveighting at all
   1: read from the file and modify
        (recommended)
   2: do not read from the file; start from the same WL weights for all orders and modify this set
        (use it if you do not have any a-priory guess)
   3: import from the file, but not modify 
If input file is absent, option 1 and 3 coincide with 2 and 0, respectively.

whether to read self-energy from the external file
Possible values
   0: do not read
   1: read from file "Delta.dat" the same self-energy for all zones

$rotate_basis$
0
whether to rotate basis for the observables; 
file "gg.dat" contains only diagonal elements of the Green function; the same information
is used in the sampling procedure/ One may want to deal with, say, momentum representation for 
the Green function. In this case, write an appropriate file "rotate.dat". 
For simple cases, do not bother youself, an put this flag zero.
